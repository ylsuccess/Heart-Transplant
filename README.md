# Heart-Transplant

To help hearts-matching for the patients with the highest survivability rates


If there are enough hearts available for all patients, all will get a heart transplant. 

On the other hand, if there are not enough hearts for every patient, then age, urgency level, and heart condition of the patients  

are taken into consideration as to decide who should be the priority group of patients to get heart transplant with a limited amount of hearts.
